<p align="center"> DO NOT INTERACT
<p align="center"> Kins of Caesar Zeppeli, Risotto Nero, Trish Una, Noriaki Kakyoin [JJBA], Shanks [One Piece] or Muzan Kibutsuji [KNY]
<p align="center"> Anyone under 18, I am an adult, I don't see a reason for me to befriend minors.
<p align="center"> If you cause or start drama. I don't care about any of your petty issues, go find someone who does.
<p align="center"> Enmu x Muzan shippers. I don't ship these characters and don't want to be bothered by those who do.

<p align="center"> ㅤㅤ

<p align="center"> BEFORE YOU INTERACT
<p align="center"> I don't mind anyone sitting with me. I won't yell at you for it like others do. If I am with friend(s), ask me first please.
<p align="center"> I am usually up for chatting, but I get tired of conversing easily, I will let you know when I wish to stop.
<p align="center"> I'm AFK or Off-Tab often, if you try to speak to me and I don't respond, I did not see your message.
<p align="center"> If I am sitting with a friend as two characters, that does NOT mean we are shipping them. Ask before you assume.
<p align="center"> I am typically a very friendly person but that doesn't mean I cannot be mean if I need to be.
